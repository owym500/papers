# Introduction
We present here aircraft measurements of SOA over Niger, using an Aerodyne aerosol mass spectrometer (Allan, 2004). 
Joe Bloggs has already made some awesome measurements, but hasn't answered all the science yet. 
Jim Haywood (2000) made aircraft measurements over the Sahel, focusing on radiative forcings.

#Simulations

#Methodology
Measurements were made using an AMS, as decsribed in Allan et al 2003.
